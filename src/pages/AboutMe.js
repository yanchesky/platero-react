    <div> O mnie </div>
    <p> 
      Miguel Platero (Madrid, 1973) is an architect and painter whose work is a continuous
      exploration of the multiple relationships between form and color. On
      recycled canvas (planks, cardboard, doors, papers) he recounts historic genres such as landscape or
      portrait. Strongly influenced by the classic visual avant - garde and abstract Expressionism, 
      his works are a modern proposal of color structures that freely roam between the figurative and abstraction.

      After graduating (1999) from the Higher Technical School of Architecture in Madrid,
      he enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts in the capital of Spain. Since then, he practices
      both. As an architect he has worked on some of the most prestigious offices in Spain. In
      2007 he opened his own design and art studio in Warsaw, Poland.

      Over more than two decades he has had regular exhibitions both in Spain and abroad. In 2018, the Madrid gallery MovART
      showed a wide selection of his paintings. Before, in 2017, the Dom Kultury Kolorowa of Warsaw
      exhibited some of his more recent works and in 2016 his paintings were on display in the Kotlownia Gallery (Poland).
      Geographical settings mean a lot to him. He is an artist traveling through Poland, Spain,
      Italy, Romania, Egypt, Serbia and France where he finds sources of inspiration for his
      works. He took part in collective exhibitions, the Art Marbella and Estampa fairs
      (2019), the Spring Salon of Painting and Graphic Arts in Warsaw (2016) or Gallery 33, in the Polish city of Ostrów Wielkopolski.
      His paintings can be found in public and private collections and has been awarded in several national (12th Spring Show of Valdepeñas, 4th
      Show of Abstract Art or ‘Night’ Contest of Toledo) and international competitions (Alternatives 33, Poland)
